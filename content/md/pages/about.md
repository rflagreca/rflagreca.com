I'm a software engineer living in Edinburgh, currently working for HelloRelish.

My particular interests are functional programming, mobile development, web development and product strategy.

Formerly I was a Rubyist at carwow but I'm generally language agnostic. Right now I'm writing mostly Clojure and Javascript.
